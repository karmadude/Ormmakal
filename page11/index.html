<blockquote>Creativity comes from my mind, from my little knowledge; I am a villager, so I get lot of inspiration from my daily life</blockquote>
I am always on the lookout for artists from Kerala, and I am glad I chanced up on Alappuzha based graphic artist, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15964547@N00/">Unni MP's</a> fascinating Kerala style illustrations on flickr. They have a very rustic modern feel to them and very unique.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickshaw">Rickshaws</a> are such an integral part of life in Kerala, and for that matter India, that memories of Kerala are never complete with out a few sprinkles of rickshaw memories. 

I can remember as far back as kindergarten, when Vandikaran used to haul me and a bunch of kids to school in his little cycle rickshaw. All of us in our red and white checkered St. Theresa's school uniforms cramped into the rickshaw, with our plastic bottles and school bags dangling on the sides of the rickshaw. <!--more-->

<img style="float: right;" src="http://www.ormmakal.com/images/illustrations/autometer.jpg" alt="Auto meter" />Flash forward to first grade, and Vandikaran's cycle rickshaw was no more, instead replaced by a motorized version, the auto rickshaw. There was this time when Kunjachan uncle, loaded all the kids into Vandikaran's new auto rickshaw, while he was not looking, and took us all for a joy ride. I can even remember the two getting into a heated argument after the joy ride. That joy ride, I can never forget, and from that day on one of my dreams was to take an auto rickshaw for a ride.

Then things changed, the family moved to Dubai, and auto rickshaws were no more a part of life, except when I got to ride them during summer vacations in Kerala. However, the story did not end there. It was 11th grade, and the first Gulf War broke out. My dad was concerned about our safety, and shipped us all back to Kerala. We were back in Kerala and auto rickshaws were once again a part of life. 

<blockquote class="pullq">
The word "rickshaw" originates from the Japanese word jinrikisha, which literally means "human-powered vehicle."
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickshaw">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>

By now, Vandikaran had retired and we had two new auto rickshaw drivers, Domenic and Babu, who hauled us to school and back. Domenic was chilled out, and I constantly hassled him to allow me to drive the rickshaw. He was reluctant at first, and then one day it happened. We were getting back from school. Along the way, Domenic stopped the rickshaw, made me get in the drivers seat, and gave me my first rickshaw driving lesson. The joy of that moment was priceless, a dream come true. Before long I got the hang of driving a rickshaw, and I can still remember driving the rickshaw on those back roads from home to school.

<blockquote>In North India, there is a variation, powered by a <em>Harley-Davidson</em> engine, called the <strong>phat-phati</strong> because of the sound it makes.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


Today, whenever I go back to Kerala, an auto rickshaw is my favorite mode of transport. To help capture some of these memories, I started taking photos while riding around in an auto rickshaw, and created a flickr group, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/74129766@N00/">View from a Rickshaw</a>, so some of you can share your favorite auto rickshaw photos with the rest of us. 

On my last trip to Kerala, I met Domenic again, after almost 14 years. He was older, still drives his auto rickshaw, and still remembers that day when he let me drive his auto rickshaw.

<em>In the childhood memories of every good cook, there's a large kitchen, a warm stove, a simmering pot and a mom.</em>
<strong>Barbara Costikyan</strong>
</blockquote>
Like most people, one thing I miss often is my <em>Amma's cooking</em>. Over the years, I have come to the conclusion that no matter how many new, exciting and tasty cuisine I find, absolutely nothing can replace Amma's cooking. I never realized this up until I left home after high school, and  I no longer got my daily servings of <strong>Amma's finest dishes</strong>, expect during those, once a year, short three week vacation to visit Amma, you know that time when you pig out on your mom's cooking! <!--more-->

In the beginning, to supplement the cravings for Amma's cooking, I started bringing back pickles, chammanthi podi, spices, and anything to suppress the cravings, and get through the year without being too nostalgic about food. However, this was no substitute, and I started eating out a lot, trying out new Indian restaurants, hoping to find one with similar tastes to <em>Amma's cooking</em>. The food was good, but none came close, and it got expensive in a hurry. 

Instead, I decided to go frugal, and turned to ready made, easy to make, meals in a box kind of stuff from the Indian store. They were reasonable priced, but other than that, they were far worse than the restaurant food. I dropped that idea fast and moved on to <a href="http://www.pachakam.com/">recipes on the internet</a>.  Initially, there was some hope: the food tasted fine, the body got some benefit from the use of fresh ingredients and good spices, and things were starting to look good. However, it still did not taste right, still not at par with Amma's cooking, and not even a close substitute.

That's when it dawned on me, why not just ask Amma, find out how she made things, write it down, and probably things will start tasting like Amma's food. I could not have been so wrong about that assumption! Suddenly, a new window opened into the world of cooking, of which I had no clue. My mom did not just throw in a few things into a pot, and it tasted good. There were a <strong>whole lot of science, math and art involved in her cooking</strong>, including years of experience. She not only knew what the ingredients did from a taste point of view, but she knew their effects on health and well being. She knew what combination of ingredients did, the proportion and measurement of ingredients, and various cooking techniques; <em>years of experience and honing of skills</em>. I knew then, this was not as easy as writing a recipe down and following it, instead I will have to learn this art form from my Amma.

What followed was a great lesson in life, on how traditions, culture, and skills passed from generation to generation, the importance of that transfer and transition, and how such precious information could be lost when people migrate and lose touch with their roots.

<strong>To be concluded...</strong>

I have decided to jump the gun and launch Ormmakal before completion of the site. The blog has been sitting on the back burner for over a year now, and it would have continued to stay that way if I had not forced this launch. It's not desperation on my part to push an idea, but an attempt to give the idea some wings, and hope for it to take off. Most of the missing content and broken links will be added and fixed as the blog evolves.<!--more-->

<h2>What is Ormmakal about?</h2>As someone who grew up and lived mostly outside Kerala, I have always valued all my experiences with Kerala, and those enthralling experiences have resulted in memories which every now and then transform into nostalgia. Ormmakal is an attempt to journey through and share some of those memories, and in the process create a resource on Kerala for everyone who gets nostalgic about Kerala. Ormmakal will be a blog for all nostalgic Malayalees. If you are in a far away land, and longing for <a href="http://www.keralatourism.com/">Kerala</a>, then this will be the place for you. Other than that core idea, I am hoping the rest of the blog will evolve and take a character of it's own.

<h2>Why is Ormmakal not in Malayalam?</h2>I would have loved for Ormmakal to be in Malayalam; unfortunately my level of Malayalam is probably that of a 5th grader. Other than that sad reason, I wanted the blog to be accessible to a wider audience.

With that little introduction, I would like to invite everyone to ormmakal.com, and hope some of you will share those priceless memories of Kerala that makes us all nostalgic.
