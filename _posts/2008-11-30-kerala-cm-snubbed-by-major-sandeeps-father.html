Slain NSG commando <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandeep_Unnikrishnan">Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan's</a> father <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Major_Unnikrishnans_father_refuses_to_meet_Kerala_CM/articleshow/3777042.cms">refuses to see</a> Kerala CM V S Achuthanandan and home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, who had flown to Bangalore to give their condolences. 

<blockquote>Unnikrishnan reportedly said he would commit suicide if any politician entered his house.

He had told his friends that his son, whose valour was witnessed by the entire country, did not belong to Kerala alone but to the entire nation.</blockquote> 

Looks like these shameless politicians have yet to have a wake up call!
