Many of the roads constructed and maintained by PWD across Kerala are in miserable conditions. Often protests and court orders are required to make the PWD to something about the roads, leaving individuals with very few options. But there is a <a href="http://www.keralapwd.gov.in/getPage.php?page=Toll%20Free%20Helpline&pageId=316">helpline number</a> people can use to complain about the state of roads in Kerala.

The toll free number to call is: <strong>1800-425-7771</strong> The helpline is open from 9:30am to 5:30pm on all working days.
If no action is taken within 48 hours, then call <strong>0471-251-8124</strong>

If you have noticed road related issues in your locality, do call the helpline, and post a comment about your experience.
