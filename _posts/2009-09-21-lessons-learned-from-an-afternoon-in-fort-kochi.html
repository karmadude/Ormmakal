An afternoon trip to Fort Kochi ended up being both very interesting and educational. Since it was Eid holiday, most places were closed, and so it was a very calm and peaceful afternoon in Fort Kochi. 

<h2>1. Take the Ferry, it's really cheap</h2>
<a class="alignleft" href="http://www.ormmakal.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_0855.jpg"><img src="http://www.ormmakal.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_0855-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_0855" title="IMG_0855" height="120" /></a>The ferry to Fort Kochi costs just Rs 2.50, can't believe it's still that cheap. The only catch is, that the ticket can be bought only prior to travel. Ticket lines can be long too depending on the day, but ladies lines are usually shorter. The beautiful views of Vembanad lake and Kochi from the ferry is an added bonus.

<h2>2. Kerala's Labor Shortage</h2>

There were hundreds of worker from Assam, who were headed to Fort Kochi for the holiday. I struck a conversation with one of the workers, and from him I was able to gather that most of them work for Rs 190 a day for about 12 hours of work. They are given really poor housing, and have to pay for rest of their expenses. 

Most of them work for a few years, and head back home. Even though hearing about their hardships was hard; it was refreshing to see them take a day off, shoot videos and snaps with their cell phones, and have a good time in Fort Kochi.  

<h2>3. Chinese fishing nets are there for tourists</h2>
<a class="alignleft" href="http://www.ormmakal.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_0838.jpg"><img src="http://www.ormmakal.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_0838-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_0838" title="IMG_0838" width="120" /></a>According to the fishermen in Fort Kochi, the Chinese fishing nets no longer catch the quantity of fish it used to 20 years back. They blame mostly the <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/2003/09/09/stories/2003090906470400.htm">polluted waters</a> for the decline in fish numbers. The pollution is mostly from all the Kochi canals that dump into Vembanad lake. So, the fishing nets are there mostly for tourists now, and the fishermen make their living mainly out of whatever the tourists give them for the Chinese net fishing experience. 

<h2>4. The Majestic Rain Trees</h2>

Some of them are giants among trees, and as you enjoy their cooling shade, don't forget to look up and take in their breathtaking size and beauty. They are <a href="http://kerala.typepad.com/kerala_vacations/2009/07/rain-trees.html">an ecosystem in itself</a>, and whoever planted them here, was probably going for their cooling shade and majestic beauty. For that visionary we should be forever grateful.
