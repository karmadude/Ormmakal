Ghost Ryderz, a motorcycle stunt team based out of Thiruvananthapuram.

<blockquote>"Ghost Ryderz" is a team of young biking fanatics which started off as a small group of tourers but has now evolved to a fully-fledged stunt team. The primary reason was equal passion among the members to take the team to a different level. The team now comprises of approximately 70 members across the state.</blockquote>
