There are many things in India which either refuse to change or change at such a slow rate that by the time change happens, the rest of the world has moved on. Kochi as a city, is a microcosm of many of the stereotypical change resistant issues facing India, and among the many, the one that has been bothering me recently are the state of the roads in Kochi. 

So, this blog is directed towards <a href="http://www.corporationofcochin.net/mayor.html">Prof. Mercy Williams</a> (<a href="http://www.ldf.org.in/">LDF</a>), the Mayor of Kochi; and <a href="http://ernakulam.nic.in/dc.htm">Dr. M. Beena IAS</a>, the District Collector of Ernakulam. I am a little skeptical to begin this blog, because if under the watch of these two highly educated women, Kochi continues to be the way it is, who then can bring about real change here?
