Recently I chanced upon an amazing collection of 22 infrared images of Kerala, by <a href="http://www.polonskyfineart.com/about.php">Jake Polonsky</a>, taken with Russian panoramic Horizon cameras and Kodak HIE infrared film. The images invoke a sense of nostalgia and have a rustic feel to it; very creative.

<blockquote>Jake's work is focused on the evocation of pure and ancient landscapes. These artworks are about recording an unspoilt landscape, where evidence of modern human interference has been kept to a minimum. In attempting to preserve these environments by creating timeless pictures he evokes images from photography's origin. His combination of infrared film and split toned printing creates the feeling of an historical image, the sense of someone observing these places with a camera for the first time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Kodak HIE infrared film is itself an endangered material. Originally used for aerial reconnaissance it is incredibly sensitive, requires delicate handling, and its lack of an anti-halation backing makes it very liable to flare. But this also gives a magical quality to my subjects - the blown out highlights of living vegetation literally glow with light. And though through experience I have a good idea of what my results will be, working with HIE is not so much documenting or recording landscape - because the material itself has this unknown quality [we are after all photographing part of the spectrum not visible to the naked eye] - as transforming it"</blockquote>

<strong>What made you focus on Kerala? And what are your impressions about the place?</strong>

<strong>Jake Polonsky:</strong> I worked on a film there in 1998 with Merchant Ivory for three months, and loved it. Went back in 2005-6 for a holiday but with cameras and intent to photograph! Hope to come back some day.
