So, today while driving to Sneha Bhavan in Palluruthy for getting started with volunteering with Make a Difference, I got into an accident. 

<h3>The Accident</h3>

The area was new to my, so Missy and I were relying on Google maps to get us to the location. Like most lost travelers we missed the left turn, and so I pulled to the curb to make a U-turn. The coast looked clear and I committed to the turn, but it was then I noticed a black scooter turn the corner, and heading right for us. There was nothing I could do, it was too later, the scooter tried to break, but there was not enough breaking distance, so it crashed into the front right side of the car.

It all happened really fast, I could see the bewilderment in the scooter rider eyes, as the scooter collided with our car, and then the rider and the pillion jumped off and the scooter fell to the ground. Even though the whole thing looked shocking, the people on the scooter were still up, the rider mad at me, and the pillion was hurting a little from the impact with his partner. I got out immediately to make sure the two people from the scooter were not injured and apologetic for my misjudged U-turn. 

<h3>The Crowd</h3>

Even though I have heard of crowd justice in India when it comes to road accidents, I have never experienced one, and a small group of men were starting to get involved in trying to find a quick settlement for the accident. So I went with instinct and called the police, thinking I have no experience with this situation, so let people who know what to do deal with it. 

So, I dialed 100 and got the dispatch right away, and they wanted to know the location of the accident. Since, I was new to the area, I handed the phone to a bystander and quickly provided the direction to the police. The police were now on their way, and so we waited. Then the man who gave directions to the police, turned to me and said I should settle the matter now, pay the scooter guy whatever he wants. I then let him know that the police is on their way, and we will get everything resolved once they get here and let insurance handle the claims. 

To my surprise, this bystander's next question was, "who called the cops?" What surprised me was, he had no clue that he was actually giving the directions to the police. When I let him know this, he had an embarrassing smile on his face and said that he thought I had called a friend. Once the crowd justice team realized the police were on the way, they mellowed down.

<h3>The Police</h3>
The Mattancherry police got to the scene in a few minutes. After a little bit of questioning to get a handle on what transpired, the cops initial approach was not very different from that of the crowd justice team. They too wanted us to come up with a settlement amount there and have the case closed without even opening a case.

<h3>The SI</h3>

We got to the station which was just a few meters from the accident scene. The police station itself had that feel of a police station we have all seen in many a Malayalam scenes. While we waited outside for the Sub Inspector of Police to see us, I was in awe of how accurately Malayalam moves have represented Police in Kerala. It's really not that different in reality except that it was all real now, and I could almost sense an SI grabbing me by the neck and dragging me into one of the jail cells and giving me a few standard elbow on the back and knee to the stomach.
