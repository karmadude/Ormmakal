<em>Namukku Parkkan Munthiri Thoppukal</em> (1986) (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249047/">IMDB</a>) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nammukku_paarkkaan_munthiri_thoppukal">Wikipedia</a>), a movie by <a href="http://rajamohan.blogspot.com/2005/09/padmarajan-loss-in-january.html">P. Padmarajan</a>, Starring Mohanlal, Shari, Thilakan, Vineeth, and Kaviyoor Ponnamma; and based on the Malayalam novel, <em>Nammukku Graamangalil Chennu Raappaarkkaam</em> by K. K. Sudhakaran. 

Padmarajan's movies are something else, and this is truly one of his best. I had watched this as a kid, but only seeing it again now, could really appreciate the greatness of this movie. The story telling, Padmarajan's genius in bringing out the best in every actor in the movie, the dialogs, the music, the simplicity, and brilliant performances by Thilakan and Mohanlal, makes it a movie that leaves you thinking about it even after the movie has ended.
