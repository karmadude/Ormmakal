I have decided to jump the gun and launch Ormmakal before completion of the site. The blog has been sitting on the back burner for over a year now, and it would have continued to stay that way if I had not forced this launch. It's not desperation on my part to push an idea, but an attempt to give the idea some wings, and hope for it to take off. Most of the missing content and broken links will be added and fixed as the blog evolves.<!--more-->

<h2>What is Ormmakal about?</h2>As someone who grew up and lived mostly outside Kerala, I have always valued all my experiences with Kerala, and those enthralling experiences have resulted in memories which every now and then transform into nostalgia. Ormmakal is an attempt to journey through and share some of those memories, and in the process create a resource on Kerala for everyone who gets nostalgic about Kerala. Ormmakal will be a blog for all nostalgic Malayalees. If you are in a far away land, and longing for <a href="http://www.keralatourism.com/">Kerala</a>, then this will be the place for you. Other than that core idea, I am hoping the rest of the blog will evolve and take a character of it's own.

<h2>Why is Ormmakal not in Malayalam?</h2>I would have loved for Ormmakal to be in Malayalam; unfortunately my level of Malayalam is probably that of a 5th grader. Other than that sad reason, I wanted the blog to be accessible to a wider audience.

With that little introduction, I would like to invite everyone to ormmakal.com, and hope some of you will share those priceless memories of Kerala that makes us all nostalgic.
