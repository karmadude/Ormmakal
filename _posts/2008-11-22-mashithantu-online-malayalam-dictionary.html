Mashithantu is an adipoli Malayalam to Engilsh and English to Malayalam online dictionary. The dictionary contains over 58,000 Malayalam words and almost 24,000 English Words. What makes Mashithantu amazing are the following features:

<h2>Word Correction</h2>

Mashithantu has a spell checking engine which will spit out similar words or correct words. For people like me who struggle with Malayalam spellings, this is a fabulous feature. Currently you have to double click the suggested word to select it. If this could be a link like in Google, that will help avoid any user confusion.

<h2>Double Click</h2>

Any English or Malayalam word on the Mashithantu  site can be double clicked to initiate a search.

<h2>Crowd Sourcing</h2>
To help the dictionary grow, users have the option to provide missing words and the details of the missing words via the <a href="http://www.mashithantu.com/malayalam-dictionary/add_words.html">add words page</a>.

<h2>Manglish Support</h2>
Mashithantu has excellent Manglish support both for entering Malayalam words, and for reading search results. One of the cool features of the site is the on-screen Malayalam keyboard with Manglish available as a tooltip over each Malayalam letter. Either a toggle to switch to a Manglish keyboard or Manglish visible along with Malayalam letter will be a nice addition.
