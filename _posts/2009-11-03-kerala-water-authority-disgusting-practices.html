Recently Kerala Water Authority(KWA) was in the neighborhood to fix a blocked sewer system, and as a result I got to witness the way KWA does things, which unfortunately has not progressed much over the years.

<a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1392786/ormmakal/images/2009/11/IMG_0903.JPG"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1392786/ormmakal/images/2009/11/IMG_0903-150x150.jpg" alt="IMG_0903" title="IMG_0903" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-278" /></a>Firstly, I found it very strange and troubling that the very authority that supplies us clean water, is the one responsible for the sewerage systems in Kerala. It will be well worth an investigation to find out what really goes on behind the scenes. Even more disturbing, <a href="http://keralawater.org/sewer.htm">KWA started back in 1938 plans to build modern sewer systems in Kerala</a>. It's 2009 and only two cities, Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi have sewer systems, with work progressing in Guruvayoor. So, if you are expecting sewer systems along "modern lines" in Kerala in your lifetime, you can forget about it!

If that has been discerning, the rest of this post is not going make things any better. The KWA workers who lower themselves down into the disgusting sewerage waters are not offered any sort of protective or safety gear. In the land of rubber, these workers don't even have rubber boots, gloves, or any other sort of protective clothing. Sewage work anywhere is a dirty job, but at least KWA could better equip their workers to make their working conditions bearable.

The KWA workers dumped the water from the blocked sewage pipe into the nearby open rain gutters. These rain gutters in Kochi don't even drain rain water properly, and so the stinking sewage water dumped into the rain gutters, started to quickly overflow in to the neighborhood and stinking up the place.

<a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1392786/ormmakal/images/2009/11/IMG_0896.jpg"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1392786/ormmakal/images/2009/11/IMG_0896-150x150.jpg" alt="Solid water from sewage being carried away in plastic bags rip!" title="Solid water from sewage being carried away in plastic bags rip!" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-282" /></a>Lastly, there is no planning, no supervision, or any professionals involved; just poorly equipped and probably poorly paid KWA workers making random decisions on how to fix things. When the water was being dumped into the rain gutters, there was no thought put into the consequences of the action, the potential stench and disease the sewerage water can spread. It was business as usual, and same practices as they have been doing for decades. To make things even more disgusting, the solid waste from the sewage was being transported in plastic waste bags, which obviously ripped and spread more filth in the neighborhood.

<blockquote>"We will provide quality water supply and wastewater services in an environmental  friendly and sustainable manner"</blockquote>

That is the vision of <a href="http://keralawater.org">Kerala Water Authority</a>, the ideals the KWA needs to stick to are all in that vision. Unfortunately, like most things in Kerala, such statements are either ignored, or even unknown to most. As a first step, KWA needs to not only change its ways but also become a department which sticks to its own vision statement for a change.

KWA is pretty much the soul of cities in Kerala. Without it's clean water, and collection and treatment of sewage, cities in Kerala will become unlivable, filthy, and disease prone. With a little bit of re-thinking, re-structuring, and a whole lot of action, <a href="http://keralawater.org">KWA</a> can change all this and make Kerala a lot more cleaner.
