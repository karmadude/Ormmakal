<blockquote>Creativity comes from my mind, from my little knowledge; I am a villager, so I get lot of inspiration from my daily life</blockquote>
I am always on the lookout for artists from Kerala, and I am glad I chanced up on Alappuzha based graphic artist, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15964547@N00/">Unni MP's</a> fascinating Kerala style illustrations on flickr. They have a very rustic modern feel to them and very unique. Check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15964547@N00/">his flickr page</a> for more from his collection of illustrations, photographs and other graphical work.

Unni is 35 years old, with over 10 years of experience in advertising. He also runs a drawing coaching center for children under 12, and in his own words, <em>"The main objective of the curriculum is to develop their skills in drawing, painting , how one can create innovative ideas, that will reflect in their character."</em>
