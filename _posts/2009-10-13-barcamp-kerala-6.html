For those who are not familiar with <a href="http://barcamp.org">Barcamps</a>, it's an informal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> where people gather to share and learn from each other. Barcamps are great for meeting and getting to know people in your local area with similar interests and passions.

This was my first time at a Barcamp in Kerala, and the first challenge was getting there. Having started to drive in India just a couple of days back was not favorable, but being a Sunday the traffic was less and Google Map directions via iPhone made things easier.  Other than a couple of wrong turns, the getting there part was not too bad.

Overall the Barcamp was great to both put faces on some of the tweeple from twitter and to meet some of them. The venue was great, and the event was well organized. Even though I was around only for the morning sessions, I got to see some really good sessions and discussions.
