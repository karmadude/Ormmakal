A few days back I noticed these giant bats flying over my parents home in Ernakulam. They were coming from around the High Court area and headed in a south easterly direction. I had no clue what kind of bats these were, but had a hunch that they were probably coming from the <a href="http://mangalavanam.com">Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary</a>. After a little <a href="http://www.rocksea.org/the-indian-flying-fox">digging around on the web</a>, I had the answer.

These bats are called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Flying-fox">Indian Flying Fox</a>, the largest bats in the world, and they reside at Mangalavanam.
