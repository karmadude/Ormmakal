Reading the following <a href="http://entertainment.in.msn.com/bollywood/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1827986">about Resul Pookutty</a> made me watch Adoor Gopalakrishnan's "Elipathayam" yesterday.

<blockquote>If Resul’s sound design captures the muddle of the crowded Mumbai city without getting overbearing, he recalls the moment in the Adoor Goplakrishnan’s film, 'Elipathayam', when the protagonist bites stone while having a meal of rice.</blockquote>

I have always heard about Elypathayam, and for some strange reason had this imagery of a mallu comedy in my mind and never had a chance or reason to watch it up until I read about it yesterday, after Resul Pookutty won the Oscar for sound mixing in Slumdog Millionaire. 

This is a masterpiece movie, and an excellent example of movie as an art form. It's slow but brilliantly crafted, and provides a fascinating insight into the older feudal system of Kerala. And, yes I did look out for that scene where the protagonist bites a stone in his rice, a scene which otherwise would have gone unnoticed.

<blockquote>
"I wrote the script of ELIPPATHAYAM when I was going through a very painful period. I had to leave Chitralekha, which I had founded and built up over a long period of my youth. There were a lot of misunderstandings between friends and parting of ways. It was in 1979. I made ELIPPATHAYAM in 1981, the intervening period was a tormenting one in my life. It prompted me to look at myself incisively."
